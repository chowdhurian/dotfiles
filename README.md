# dotfiles

## use

1. Clone the repo into where you'd like it to live.
2. Symlink everything inside it.

## symlinking

### vscode

Assuming you cloned the repo into the `development` directory:

`ln -s ~/development/dotfiles/vscode/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json`
`ln -s ~/development/dotfiles/vscode/snippets/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/snippets`

### everything else

Most other dotfiles live in `~`
